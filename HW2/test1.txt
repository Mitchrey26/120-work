## RESPONSE TO THE QUESTIONS
This Week in coding class I learned a lot more about how to work into the git hub
and using atom to pair with the git hub. It took me a while to figure out what
all of the different tool things meant but I am slowly starting to figure it out
The steps I took to get the homework done was just making my text file and and
than creating a new repository in the git hub desktop app after that I would
take my file over to atom where I would than change the file however I wanted
and than I would finalize it again back in the git hub. I didn't really have any
issues I just kept on reworking the steps over and over again. The only thing I
keep on getting confused about is where and how I turn the homework in.

## EXAMPLE OF A PARGRAPH

MY PARAGRAPH IS A GREAT PARGRAPH IT REQUIRES NO EXTRA MARKUPS

BUT I HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT I KEEP A SPACE INBETWEEN THE LINES

## EXAMPLE OF A LINK

LINKS HAVE BRACKETS THAT SURROUND THEM AND NO SPACES IN BETWEEN THE BRACKETS

## EXAMPLE OF IMAGES MAGES ARE VERY SIMILAR TO LINKS EXECPT FOR THE FACT THAT
AN EXLAMATION POINT GOES IN FRONT OF THE BRACKETS
