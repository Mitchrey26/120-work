# Weekly Questions

## Summarize the Work you did this Week
1. During this Week of Creative coding I was able to get more Comfterable using using github and Atom, and learned about the tools in which I was able to navigate around them and use them during the class.

## What steps did you take to complete the assignment
2. I took notes in my notebook on a physical piece of paper and wrote down the different tools and their functions along with tutorials and things like that than the next day I reviewed my notes and checked that I could use the codes just by using my notes until one day I will not need the notes any more to complete the assignment.

## Did you have any problems or issues?
3. I don't like how the work is due on Thursday it makes it hard to start the work early in the week when the start of the class week is on a Friday as I hardly ever do my on Friday or Saturday, and Sunday I'm usually focusing on other classes so I really don't get started on this class till Monday, but I need to start allowing my self more time to learn the codes.

## Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further.
4. No, As I am curious about codes i feel like the will be covered in future class sessions

## What issues did you help your felloow classmates out with this past week?
5. I didn't really help anyone as whenever I looked on the git hub most the questions were answered.
