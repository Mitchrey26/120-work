Original Code
In the Original code we see that an object is made, which is a ball. The ball is can move in whichever direction on the canvas and will bounce off the edges of it. If you leave the ball bouncing off the corners for a while a very cool pattern can be formed. Unless the ball is changing direction based on the mouse being pressed. Not only does the mouse press change the direction of the ball but it will also change the speed of the ball making it faster or slower.

How did I alter the Sketch
I altered the sketch by changing the ellipse to a rectangle and the colors of the the rectangle and also the background. I also changed the speed at which the rectangle moves at so it is slower and easier to see the direction change.
