# Empty p5 sketch.

This weeks homework assignment was fun it really felt like we were creating our own image which was super fun. I wish I would have started this assignment sooner as I sort of ran out of time, but I was definetly still able to create some one that looks like me. HE even has my mustache and than a shirt that I own has those exact same stripe patterns.
