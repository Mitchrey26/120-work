## Read Me week 4

This weeks homework assignment was fun it really felt like we were creating our own image which was super fun. I didn't really have any hiccups or anything creating the image. I wish I would have started this assignment sooner as I sort of ran out of time, but I was definetly still able to create some one that looks like me. He even has my mustache and than a shirt that I own has those exact same stripe patterns.The hardest part was getting things to fit into the right spot so I eventually just ended up translating a lot of things in order to get it into the correct position.
