# Empty p5 sketch.

this week was a tough one for me, as I started out trying to do box that was just rotating with another box rotating within that, but wasn't able to figure it out. I will be at office hours next week to work on that, and answer questions just about arrays. I took the example from the guy off of youtube, and changed it so the colors would be changing all of the time, and than changed the amount of the bounce that happens in the circle. Im not sure what I was having trouble with. t may have just been labeling the function and what not. I want to just turn this one in so I make the due date, but I hope it would be okay if I turned in more of my own piece by Tuesday next week for maybe a little more credit.
