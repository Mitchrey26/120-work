# Empty p5 sketch.

this week was a tough one for me, as I started out trying to do box that was just rotating with another box rotating within that, but wasn't able to figure it out. I will be at office hours next week to work on that, and answer questions just about arrays. I took the example from the guy off of youtube, and changed it so the colors would be changing all of the time, and than changed the amount of the bounce so the ball would be still and made it so the ball would move in a direction that I wanted it to. I've come to really like having the colors change in an unpredicable way.
